# Emily and Sam's Project 3

## Overview

This repository is a basic template designed for our project. It includes all necessary folders and files with example code to guide the development process.

## Contents

### `script.js`

- Contains EXAMPLE code.
- Note: This is placeholder code and does not function as-is.

### `server.js`

- Provides the basic server setup using Node.js and Express.
- Includes example `.get` requests to demonstrate potential API interactions.

## Usage

- The `script.js` file should be modified with actual functional code as per project requirements.
- The `server.js` file serves as a starting point for server configuration and API endpoint creation.
