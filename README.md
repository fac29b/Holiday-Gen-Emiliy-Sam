# Emily and Sam's Project 3

## Overview

In this project, as part of our final Founders and Coders assignment, we have created a random holiday generator. Using the REST Countries Unsplash Images, and the OpenAI APIs, with the click of a button a seven-day holiday itinerary is generated, including images of your destination. Instead of imposing our own morality and judgements on the safety and security of different countries, GenHoliday exists in a utopia where there are no conflicts and everyone is free to travel anywhere. Click a button, sit back, and see where GenHoliday takes you!

## Contents

To run this code yourself, you will need to clone the repository and download dependancies:

```bash
npm install
```

From there create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the API key:

```env
openaiAPI=your_openAI_api_key
unsplashAPI=you_unsplash_api_key
```

Replace those keys with your personal API keys for OpenAI and Unsplash. REST Countries API does not require a key.

### `script.js`

- Contains EXAMPLE code.
- Note: This is placeholder code and does not function as-is.

### `server.js`

- Provides the basic server setup using Node.js and Express.
- Includes example `.get` requests to demonstrate potential API interactions.

## Usage

- The `script.js` file should be modified with actual functional code as per project requirements.
- The `server.js` file serves as a starting point for server configuration and API endpoint creation.
